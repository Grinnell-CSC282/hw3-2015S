    * Part 0: Create a directory for yourself in the repo.
    * Part 1: Write a program that cleans up after `script`.  Put it
      in the repo.  (I'd recommend using C, but it's up to you.)
        * I'm sure you can find one.  You learn more by writing it.
    * Part 2: Write a bash script that finds all of the files under
      the current directory that end with .jpg and moves them to a
      directory called images.  Put it in the repo.
    * Part 3: Forthcoming.
