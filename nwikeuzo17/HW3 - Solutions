Part 0: Create a directory for yourself in the repo.

Part 1: Write a program that cleans up after script. Put it in the
repo. (I'd recommend using C, but it's up to you.)
The Unix tr command can be used. It has the syntax:
tr -cd '\11\12\15\40-\176' < file-with-binary-chars > clean-file

Part 2: Write a bash script that finds all of the files under the current directory that end with .jpg and moves them to a directory called images. Put it in the repo.
Solution: find . -name "*.jpg" -exec mv {} /mydir \;
