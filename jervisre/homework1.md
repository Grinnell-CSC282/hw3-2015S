- Part 1: Write a program that cleans up after script.
  Put it in the repo. (I'd recommend using C, but it's up to you.)
	+ See (mostly functional) script.c
- Part 2: Write a bash script that finds all of the files under the current
  directory that end with .jpg and moves them to a directory called
  images. Put it in the repo.
	+ See movejpg script

- Part 3: Suppose I have a file called * in my directory.
  How do I remove? Suppose I have a file called -rf *, how do I delete it?

 - rm -- *
 - rm -- -rf\ *
